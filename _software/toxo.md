Toxo is a MATLAB library for GWAS dataset simulation. It calculates penetrance
tables of epistasis models of any interaction order. Toxo is capable of
calculating penetrance tables with extreme values of prevalence and/or
heritability, which in turn allows to generate datasets resembling real
populations more closely.
